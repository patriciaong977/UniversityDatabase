# University Database Project
###### Patricia Ong, Brian Edwards, Benjamin Ahn
###### Semester Project at California State University, Fullerton for CPSC 332 - File Structure & Database

---
## Project
For us to fully incorporate what we learned in databases, we were tasked to design a mock university database with mock values. The database consists of professors, students, departments, courses, sections, and enrollment records.

---
## Project Solution
Our group created a simple Web Application which connects to a MariaDB database of a university we have constructed. The web application uses a HTML Front-End and a PHP Back-End that displays the results from the database to the user through SQL statements.

---
### Visualization
The CSUF server was only available for a limited time. I have provided example runs to show the final product.

## Inside the Database
The database is utilized with MariaDB in our CSUF server, which is impossible to connect to locally. The following are screenshots of the database:
