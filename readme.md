# University Database Project
###### Patricia Ong, Brian Edwards, Benjamin Ahn
###### Semester Project at California State University, Fullerton for CPSC 332 - File Structure & Database

---
## Project
For us to fully incorporate what we learned in databases, we were tasked to design a mock university database with mock values. The database consists of professors, students, departments, courses, sections, and enrollment records.

---
## Project Solution
Our group created a simple Web Application which connects to a MariaDB database of a university we have constructed. The web application uses a HTML Front-End and a PHP Back-End that displays the results from the database to the user through SQL statements.

-- 
## Inside the Database
The database is utilized with MariaDB in our CSUF server, which is impossible to connect to locally. The following are screenshots of the database: 

### Professor
### Student
### Department
### Course
### Section 
### Enrollment Record
### College Degree
Note: This is a Multi-Valued Attribute from Professor
### Meeting Days
Note: This is a Multi-Valued Attribute from Section
### Pre-requisite Courses
Note: This is a Multi-Valued attribute from Course

### Visualization
As I mentioned earlier, the CSUF server that was available to us was only available for a limited time. I have provided example runs to show the final product.
